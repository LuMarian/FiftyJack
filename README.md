# FiftyJack

Python/Flask - HTML/CSS/JS
BlackJack game - Final Project for the CS50 web track - programmed on VSC ("to get the training wheels off")

You will need a Flask environment to run this program.


It requires the user to give a name and the number of chips he wants to start with.
Then it starts the game that follows the basic blackjack rules. The only thing that has not been implemented is the split option of blackjack, as that would have gone a little beyond the scope of this final project. However, just like a multiplayer table, it should be reasonably easy to implement in the backend as players are objects.
The frontend however... well, at least not worth my time for now... :-)

The cards are visualized and drawn from a random generated carddeck out of 4 52-card-decks, the chips on the table are also being visualized according to the bet amount.

A few things that I would like to further implement are AJAX/jQuery to update the cards without reloading the page, a database to store user data and maybe also get the code a little cleaner in general.
However, I currently do not want to go into web programming (planning to follow up with CS50's Introduction to AI), so while I really enjoyed learning a lot of the web basics, I did not feel the need to spend countless more hours of fine-tuning the project before submitting it.
Let's see how much I will come back to this game in the future and improve on it :-)
